# Youjuke (Version 2.0)

Deployed application: https://youjuke2.herokuapp.com/

### **What is Youjuke?** 

Youjuke is a music forum that allows groups of visitors to compile a shared playlist and listen to it together, live. Anyone can add a track to the playlist, but it is up to all users as a whole to decide the order of the playlist. Whether you want to share tracks with a larger audience, or want to break out into a virtual party with friends, Youjuke has you covered.

Want to know which music the audience likes? Youjuke keeps track of the user music preferences and favorite tracks.

**Motivation behind developing Youjuke**
* Virtual listening parties with friends or strangers
* More meaningful music recommendations from others rather than algorithms
* Sharing experiences remotely

Let you be the algorithm to your listening party.

### **How do I use Youjuke?**

* First, create an account or log in.
* Click on the 'rooms' tab to see existing rooms. Click on one you would like to enter.
* If you want to create a room, click on the '+' tab.
* Once you are in your room, there may be songs already cued up. Click on the play button to begin.
* Due to licensing, this version of Youjuke currently only plays previews and not complete songs.
* Like with radio, as you (or others in the room) listen to songs, they will be cycled out of the cue and the playlist will be updated live.
* Want to hear that song you just added more than any of the others already in the playlist? Give that song a thumbs up to vote up its position. If that song has more has more thumbs-ups than the other tracks, it will come on after the current song.
* Hate a song in the playlist? Give that song a thumbs down. The most down-voted songs will appear at the bottom of the playlist after the current song ends.
* There are graph tabs that show charts of music preferences of users and lists of favorite tracks of both you and other users.
